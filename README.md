## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to organise my css.
Each time i called a div i mentioned the parent to provide a css file as clear and understandable as possible.

Example :
```css
section #annualPlan #price h2{
    font-size: medium;
    padding: 0px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on responsive and javascript development.

### Useful resources

- [Box shadow](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/) - To make the shadow i used box shadow who provide html & css code.
